#How to set up your environment
I use [SublimeText2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) at the moment, because it's got the best javascript support out there.

* Install the [Package Manager](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation)
* Using PackageControl, install the [SublimeTODO plugin](https://github.com/robcowie/SublimeTODO)

TODO: 
* add info on :
	* how to build
	* how to run your tests
	* how to stub out the samsung ApplicationManager api etc. (add separate section on testing)


#Twitch.tv API
Twith.tv has an elaborate API, which you can read all about over at the [Twitch-API project on GitHub](https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API/blob/master/README.md)
