Samsung SmartTV App to watch Twitch.tv streams

## Why
I was sick of hooking up my laptop/pc to my SmartTV all the time.
And with the browser app not working properly on Twitch.tv, I just decided to build this app.

I'm not sure how difficult it's going to be, but I'll figure it out eventually.

## Warning: adapt your expectations.
To those of you expecting this project to be an instant solution to your problem, I'm sorry but until I've added rudimentary features this project is not the one you're looking for.
Instead, have a look at [this other, working, SmartTV app for Twitch.tv](https://github.com/mkvd/smarttv-twitch).
